# MiniProjects

This contains a list of projects that I have done releated to ML, DL and NLP. 

### List of the Projects in this Repository
- **Feature Selection:** This project identifies the important features from a given dataset that will produce the most accurate result. It uses GridSearchCV.
- **Text Summarization:** I have used TF-IDF to generate a summary of a given text. The logic of TF-IDF is implemented from scratch.
- **Titanic (Kaggle):** A python script that works on the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle.
- **MNIST Classifier:** This project identifies the correct number from a pool of handwritten numbers. Can be extended to the fashion - MNIST dataset too.
- **Pneumonia Detector:** Given an X-Ray of the lung section, the model can classify whether the patient suffers from pneumonia or not.
